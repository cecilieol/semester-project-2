# semester-project-2

For my semester project at Noroff fall semester 2021, we were tasked to create an e-commerce site using CSS Frameworks and vanilla JavaScript. I chose to create an online grocery home delivery service, with a selection of fruits and vegetables.

The goal was to create both customer-facing and admin sections. Customers should be able to search through products, view product details, and add and remove items from their cart. There is a log in option directing you to the admin page, giving admin rights to add, edit and delete products from the website. Building a checkout and payment system was not a part of the project.

Skills:
JavaScript (e.g. modules, localStorage, API calls, POST/PUT/DELETE requests)
Bootstrap
SCSS
Strapi API
Deployment with Heroku
