For my semester project at Noroff fall semester 2021, we were tasked to create an e-commerce site using CSS Frameworks and vanilla JavaScript. I chose to create an online grocery home delivery service, with a selection of fruits, vegetables and bulk items. This was inspired by the current pandemic and my part time job at a grocery home delivery service at the time.

## Description
The goal was to create both customer-facing and admin sections. Customers are able to search through products, view product details, and add and remove items from their cart. There is a log in option directing you to the admin page, giving admin rights to add, edit and delete products from the website. Building a checkout and payment system was not a part of the project.

Key skills used in this project:
-	GET/POST/PUT/DELETE requests
